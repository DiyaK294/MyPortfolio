                <p>I am 11 years old and I am in 6th grade. I live in Maple Hills,Washington (Its not Washington D.C, Its
                    Washington State in the west coast). And I like to draw a lot and
                    explore. I also LOVE PIZZA, and I do not like spicy food but I still eat it, I just make sure I have
                    water in case its spicy. Its also really cold in Washington so people get sick a lot. Even though it
                    gets REALLY COLD, everyone still drinks ice water and no one gets sick! There was a bomb cyclone a
                    month ago and there was no power, the fence in our house was BROKEN and the only light most people
                    had was a fireplace, a flashlight, and a candle. IT WAS CRAZY!!! Also we went to the store the next
                    day and we got some batteries for our fireplace. Then we got power 2 days later! (❁´◡`❁) (●'◡'●)</p>

                        a steady pace. I also walk about 1,000,000 (1 million) steps each day!</p>
